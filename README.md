What? Treeman is Treegirl?

No no no, this is just a joke. Actually, Treeman is a splendid self-management tool, and will be a social network system based on development( or rather self and team's growth ) and will be more than treeman( treecity, see also "What's the future" below.")...

The discription "<ruby>Decade treewood, century treeman, millenium treecity<rt>"十年树木，百年树人，千年树城"</rt></ruby>" is an old saying that came from China, which means years of practice makes something called spirituality, but it is the connection or rather cooperation that energizes the sociaty.

Therefore, what we endeavor to do is to energize the individuals and then establish the [Interpersonal_ties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties)' network based on development.

To carry it out, we create Treeman. The core of the primitive treeman is self-management system. We choose notion-project-RHC mode (this will be noted below) to help you to manage your life, work, or study etc. And what makes us  boast a lot is the plugin-support, with which you could also manage your booklist, curriculum, shopping list, wish list and the like(infinite). What's more, we have to recommend the display to you. It gives you an outline of your task and visible tools for your progress and process. As for "Today"(a function), it will enable you to do your task more systematically.

If treeman exerts a peculiar fascination on you, or you desire more details about lovely treeman, read on!

## What's NPR mode?

We take notion-project-rhc mode to help you to manage yourself.

To help you to understand this mode more clearly and fast, we can draw an analogy. We can compare an individual to a country. As is known to all, an advanced country uses legal system to administrate and supervise. Treeman is similar to the legal system. Notion is the constitution. Project is the articles of law. RHC is the statute. And more, project also resembles national strategy ( for example, B&R in China and American First Energy Plan in USA ).

![NPR Mode](https://github.com/ZenMoore/Treeman/blob/master/image/promotion/NPR_Mode.jpg?raw=true)

**Notion** records the macro programs for you, which may be lifelong. The projects and RHCs are at service for The Notion and  It may include the following items according to your preference:
*  view of life, world and value
*  long-term dream, medium-term goal and short-term target
*  book-reading structure
*  lifelong learning policy
*  personal drive policy
*  the principle, policy and process for your introspectiveness
*  the framework for your subjects and attainment
*  fixed RHC
*  ...(other items you need)

**Project** is rather a simple concept, which is plan. Needless to say it more, the following items sufficiently explain what the project covers.
* RHC Collection
* task or goal deployment
* solution to problems
* self-drive solution
* analysis or evaluation model
* experiment (tentative)
* new thought
*  ...(other items you need)

**RHC** is short for Rule, Habit and Cognition. To manage yourself, rule is in details, habit is standing, cognition is underlying(successively symbolizing precision, breadth and depth).

![NPR Mode in details](https://github.com/ZenMoore/Treeman/blob/master/image/promotion/NPR_Mode_Detail.png?raw=true)

OK, as you can see, the mode covers all the process to strengthen yourself, at least in the strategic level. Then, the operational level decides on yourself. So just do it!

## What's the function?

**Today** shows today's task.

**Plugin** provides you the extra function as long as you need and download it additionally, which provides you much more free agency.

**NPR** is the main function that gives you a display and management of your Notion, Project and RHC.

**Display** is the visualization for your NPR, today, plugins and any important and indispensable information(like the photo below).

## What's the future?

Treeman's development can be devided into three: Treewood stage, Treeman stage and Treecity stage.

**Treewood Stage(TW)** is just a tool, not a system, for it isn't networked. So it's short of vitality. The naming of the stage will use botanical names as its deputy name.

![TW](https://images.pexels.com/photos/923167/pexels-photo-923167.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=350)

**Treeman Stage(TM)** is not only a tool, but also a system, for it is networked. And because of the networking, Treeman applies SoLoMo business mode, which are socialization, localization and mobilization. We can imagine the prospect as far as possible: community,communication platform, sharing or amything else. The naming of the stage will use the names of forest animals as its deputy name.

**Treecity Stage(TC)** is not only a tool, not only a system, but also an ecology. As the crest stage, it will be integrated, sticking and romantic. We can imagine the prospect, but we don't need to, for we are more down-to-earth in the current stage: TW. The naming of the stage will use the names of the rainforests' names and other geographical names.
