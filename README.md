# What's Treeman?

A splendid self-management tool, and will be a social network system based on development( or rather self and team's growth ) and will be more than treeman( treecity )...

The discription is an old saying that came from China, which means years of practice makes something called spirituality, but it is the connection or rather cooperation that energizes the sociaty.

Therefore, what we endeavor to do is to energize the individuals and then establish the [Interpersonal_ties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_ties)' network based on development.

To carry it out, we create Treeman. The core of the primitive treeman is self-management system. We choose notion-project-RHR mode (this will be noted below) to help you to manage your life, work, or study etc. And what makes us  boast a lot is the plugin-support, with which you could also manage your booklist, curriculum, shopping list, wish list and the like(infinite). What's more, we have to recommend the display to you. It gives you an outline of your task and visible tools for your progress and process. As for "Today"(a function), it will enable you to do your task more systematically.

If treeman exerts a peculiar fascination on you, or you desire more details about lovely treeman, read on!

# What's the mode

We take notion-project-rhr mode to help you to manage yourself.

To help you to understand this mode more clearly and fast, we can draw an analogy. We can compare an individual to a country. As is known to all, an advanced country uses legal system to administrate and supervise. Treeman is similar to the legal system. Notion is the constitution. Project is the articles of law. RHR is the statute. And more, project also resembles national strategy ( for example, B&R in China and American First Energy Plan in USA ).

 **Notion** records the macro programs for you, which may be lifelong. The projects and RHRs are at service for The Notion and  It may include the following items according to your preference:
-  long-term dream, medium-term goal and short-term target
-  book-reading structure
-  lifelong learning policy
-  personal drive policy
-  the principle, policy and process for your introspectiveness
-  the framework for your subjects and attainment
-  fixed RHR
-  ...(other items you need)
